# FinderGame
A game built for the Odin project that requires users to find certain characters in images, akin to 'Where's Wally?'.


Initial Ideas and plan

So the main purpose of this project is to make use of Firebase as a backend and show my proficiency with the service.

When the user first accesses the site I would like them to login/signup using a simple username and password.

They will then see a maximum of three images that they can select with stats of their own times beneath the image.

Once they have clicked on the image they want to play they will then be greeted with a short modal detailing the instructions and a start button that
will hide the modal and start the timer for the game.

The character they need to find will then be shown to them; i am hoping to be able to randomise the character they need to find from a selection of characters in the image, so that it offers a challenge each time the user attempts another play and replayability.

So therefore each image will have a selection of characters that need to be found, each of whom will also have their own coordinates.
The user will have their own unique username and a record of their stats.

I also would like to use the react framework.
